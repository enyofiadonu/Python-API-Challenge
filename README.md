# Python-API-Challenge
This repository contains scripts the utilizes OpenWeatherMap API and Google Places API to do common statistical analysis on the weather of a list of randomly genarated cities. Then it searches for ideal cities with specific weather criteria, and finds the closest hotel near those cities. This repository is a great excersize for APIs and JSONs.

WARNING: before you download and run this repository, you will need to get and API key from OpenWeatherMap and Google Places, and put them into a python script named 'api_keys' in this format: 
       
       # OpenWeatherMap API Key
        weather_api_key = "YOUR KEY HERE!"
        # Google API Key
        g_key = "YOUR KEY HERE!"
        
   Then save the file in the same folder as the jupyter notebook scripts are.
